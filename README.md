# Python File Organizer Challenge
A small challenge that I did, where I had to code a file organizer in Python within the span of 1 hour and 30 mins. Finished it at the 1 hour and 19 mins mark. Will be adding GUI functionality to it soon

To use, first run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to make sure that glob is installed. Then, download the repo and navigate to the directory with the script in it. Finally, run ```python main.py``` and it will give you prompts to enter in the terminal.
